This app creates an HTML webpage with movie trailers which are added to the `entertainment.py` file.

To use this app, you can run or edit your favourite movies in `entertainment.py`.
`entertainment.py` uses the class `Movies` in `media.py` to create the movies objects.

The `main.py` file receives data from the `entertainment.py` as a list and creates the `HTML` file with movies titles, story line, poster and the link to the movie trailers.

To run the app, use the line below on the python console:

`python entertainment.py`
